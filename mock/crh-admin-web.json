Through partnership with Grace Chapel since 2005, World Relief Malawi has been empowering the local church in the Mzimba District to respond to the needs in their communities through leadership formation, child development projects, orphan &amp; vulnerable children care, agricultural development, savings groups, and HIV/AIDS programs. World Reliefâ€™s model places unique emphasis on ensuring churches are not only trained, but equipped to independently sustain these community-based activities. With this focus on sustainability through the Church, World Relief is working to help Malawi reach a critical tipping point, causing a ripple effect that changes the poverty paradigm throughout the entire country.\\n\\nFor more information about World Relief, please visit www.worldrelief.org."
